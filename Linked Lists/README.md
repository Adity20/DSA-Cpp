# Linked List

- Linear Data Structures
- Stores list of values
- Non-Contiguous memory: Each node within a linked list does not have to be stored next to any other node within the linked list
- Variable Size
- Insertion/Deletion at any point is easier


Node:
Consists of two segment

Data | Next


Head pointer stores the address of first pointer of linked list.


Limitations of Array:
- Fixed Size
- Contiguous block of memory
- Insertion/Deletion is costly
